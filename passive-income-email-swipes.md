## Email 2: Authority Builder

**Subject:** The 20-minute monetization audit

Hey {{ first_name }},

Quick question: how many of your current subscribers have seen a monetized offer in the last 7 days?

If the answer is anything less than 100%, you're leaving cash on the table. I recorded a 20-minute teardown showing how I line up:

- A lead magnet with a tiny tripwire
- An affiliate pick that pays 50%+ commission
- A 7-day nurture sequence that sells while I sleep

ðŸŽ¥ Watch the audit here: {{ video_link }}

If you want my team to clone this exact flow for you, grab the **Done-For-You Automations** bundle inside the dashboard.

To your next sale,
